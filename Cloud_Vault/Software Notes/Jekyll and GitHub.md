## I tried...

This morning I saw something which said it was supposedly easy to send text to a website using Jekyll. I thought I would give it a go and try to set it up. And it wasn't as easy as it looks.

The part about downloading the latest version of Ruby was easy enough. The part about installing Jekyll on the computer was easy as well. I did all of that following instructions and I did this using the terminal commands. Like a pro!

Moving onto the next instruction was a little bit more difficult. These were supposedly step-by-step instructions but somewhere along the way the steps didn't actually follow one after the other. I put stuff into the terminal to my commands and get things done but nothing happened. All paths are fun!

One of the things that gets me is that there are certain things which the gigs and the nerds do just because it is difficult and incomprehensible. It makes them feel good because they have a special power. Being able to do some special kung fu on the keyboard and have it all happen magically is pretty cool. I find there are often easier ways to do things. Why bother with using Jekyll and GitHub but when there is the perfectly good WordPress system.

## Perseverance

For the most part I like to stick out things and keep going until I get the desired result. I've probably spent about an hour of my time doing this and getting lost along the way. I'm sure it's probably the case that normal muggle would have given up long before I did. Maybe I'm turning into a muggle.
