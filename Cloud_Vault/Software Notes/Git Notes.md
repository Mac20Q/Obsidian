## Which is Right Pull or Fetch

Both words seemed the same in meaning to me but in Git there are differences.

Fetch - Fetches files

Pull - Fetches and Merges the files.


## So Use Pull 


In Shortcuts us ea Shortcut to first use Working Copy to PULL from GitHub

This way you ase starting with the latest from GitHub.
Ohterwise you could end up with merge conflicts.


## What about Push or Commit?
Whem you Push the changes how is that different to committing the changes
in Working Copy it doen;t seem necessary to stage the files first.


## Terminal or GitKraken

I always think Gitkraken sounds like Get cracking... Let's get crackin' Get the job done.

Terminal is simple enough if you are using the basic git commands. GitKraken is more visual though and some of us like to see things in pictures.
