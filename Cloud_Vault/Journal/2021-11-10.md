## Jabbed in the Arm
I've got the flu jab[^1]. It was very quick and easy. The longest part of which was waiting for an old guy who was in front of me to put his shirt and jumper back on again after getting the job. Not really a problem, I wasn't in a hurry. Now I'm in the charging point by the beach and the car is getting juiced up. I might need to have a charge in there for later on today when I go to the choir. Or possibly go to the choir. The rain is coming down at the moment and  who knows whether I will still go to the choir today.


[^footnote]The great thing about getting the car charged up here, apart from it being free is keeping warm. I've got the heating on and also running the seat heater. Lovely being toasty. especially after last night when I got back into bed again I couldn't get warm. Even when I woke up this morning my feet and legs were cold. I was tempted to get up and make a hot water bottle for myself to try and warm up.
